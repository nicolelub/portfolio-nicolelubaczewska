# Aspiring Product Associate/Analyst

#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, Excel VBA

## Education				       		
- M.S., Data Analytics	| McDaniel College (_Incoming Student, Expected Grad June 2027_)	 			        		
- B.S., Management Information Systems and Global Business | Boston University (_May 2024_)

## Work Experience
**Project Coordinator @ Boston University Advancement (_August 2024 - Present_)**
- Identified inefficiencies in data analysis for monthly donor reports, where manual processes
led to errors and delays. Automated Excel reporting with VBA, implementing a sorting and highlighting system that
accelerated workflows and improved accuracy for use of 15 front-line fundraisers
  
**Operations Analyst @ Boston Consulting Group (_September 2023 - May 2024_)**
- Led a cross-functional initiative with 7 directors across project management, data science,
engineering, design, and CRM to improve faculty-to-client staffing. Developed an expert database that reduced staffing
allocation time by 20% and increased utilization rates by 15%. These improvements boosted client feedback NPS by 10
points, secured 2 new clients, and expanded an existing project to a new region within 6 months-
- Partnered with 2 Operations Directors and 1 CRM Manager to standardize workflows across
design, engineering, and consulting teams in a newly formed department. The new model cut project timelines by 25%,
reducing planning and build time from 12 to 9 weeks, creating a scalable framework for future projects

**Project Management Intern @ PricewaterhouseCoopers (_June 2022 - July 2022_)**
- Partnered with senior management to address challenges, and implement strategic risk mitigations, leveraging agile
methodologies through Kanban tools

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
