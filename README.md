## Work Experience
**Project Coordinator @ Boston University Advancement (_August 2024 - Present_)**
- Identified inefficiencies in data analysis for monthly donor reports, where manual processes
led to errors and delays. Automated Excel reporting with VBA, implementing a sorting and highlighting system that
accelerated workflows and improved accuracy for use of 15 front-line fundraisers
  
**Operations Analyst @ Boston Consulting Group (_September 2023 - May 2024_)**
- Led a cross-functional initiative with 7 directors across project management, data science,
engineering, design, and CRM to improve faculty-to-client staffing. Developed an expert database that reduced staffing
allocation time by 20% and increased utilization rates by 15%. These improvements boosted client feedback NPS by 10
points, secured 2 new clients, and expanded an existing project to a new region within 6 months-
- Partnered with 2 Operations Directors and 1 CRM Manager to standardize workflows across
design, engineering, and consulting teams in a newly formed department. The new model cut project timelines by 25%,
reducing planning and build time from 12 to 9 weeks, creating a scalable framework for future projects

**Project Management Intern @ PricewaterhouseCoopers (_June 2022 - July 2022_)**
- Partnered with senior management to address challenges, and implement strategic risk mitigations, leveraging agile
methodologies through Kanban tools

## Projects

## Project 1: Excel VBA Automation ‚Äì Sorting & Highlighting Plans

üîç Overview: This VBA project automates Excel data processing by:

- Deleting plan rows based on org chart
- Sorting plan data based on multiple criteria
- Applying conditional formatting to highlight key dates and statuses
- Creation of different tabs and sorting of data based on specific conditions
- Clearing irrelevant data dynamically based on specific conditions
- Working within defined column ranges

This solution is useful for finance, operations, and project management teams who handle large dataset reporting in Excel.

‚öôÔ∏è Features

‚úÖ Dynamic Sorting & Highlighting ‚Äì Sorts plans by status and response dates

‚úÖ Conditional Formatting ‚Äì Colors rows based on deadlines and ownership

‚úÖ Creates and sorts data into tabs ‚Äì based on criteria of ownership

‚úÖ Data Cleanup ‚Äì Clears content dynamically when criteria detected

‚úÖ Fully Automated ‚Äì Runs with a single macro execution

### Project 2: Analysis of On-Campus Spending using Qualtrics survey and Python Regression Modelling 

- **Topic**: Analysis of dining and food services on a college campus, specifically at Boston University.  
- **Objective**: Understand food spending patterns among BU students, focusing on the impact of income, location, and meal preparation.  
- **Methodology**:  
  - Conducted a **Qualtrics survey** with 16 questions (multiple-choice, multiple-selection, and fill-in-the-blank).  
  - Focused on income sources, food spending habits, and demographic factors.  
  - **Regression analysis** used to determine spending patterns and correlations.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Most students prefer food locations within **15‚Äì30 minutes of travel**.  
  - **Popular food spots**: Starbucks, CityCo, and Panda Express.  
  - Bringing a **mealbox** to campus reduces spending on food.  
  - **Strongest predictors of spending**: CityCo, Baystate Underground, Allowance, and Age.  
- **Challenges**:  
  - Limited sample size (136 responses after cleaning from 232).  
  - High number of **missing values** and insufficient survey questions for in-depth statistical insights.  
- **Business Implications**:  
  - Insights help restaurant and store owners **optimize locations and menu offerings**.  
  - Useful for policy-making and forecasting food service demand on campus.
